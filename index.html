                <b>Cricket</b> is a bat-and-ball game that is played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. Two players from the batting team (the striker and nonstriker) stand in front of either wicket, with one player from the fielding team (the bowler) bowling the ball towards the striker's wicket from the opposite end of the pitch. The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball and then switch places with the nonstriker, with the batting team scoring one run for each exchange. Runs are also scored when the ball reaches or crosses the boundary of the field or when the ball is bowled illegally.
                <br><br>
                The fielding team tries to prevent runs from being scored by dismissing batters (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the striker's wicket and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. Forms of cricket range from Twenty20 (also known as T20), with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs (each "over" being a set of 6 fair opportunities for the batting team to score) and the game generally lasting three to four hours, to Test matches played over five days.
                <br><br>
                Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string.
                <br><br>
                The earliest known definite reference to cricket is to it being played in South East England in the mid-16th century. It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire, with the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century. The game's governing body is the International Cricket Council (<a href="https://www.icc-cricket.com/tournaments/t20cricketworldcup/index">ICC</a>), which has over 100 members, twelve of which are full members who play Test matches. The game's rules, the Laws of Cricket, are maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club (<a href="https://mcc.org.au/">MCC</a>) in London. The sport is followed primarily in South Asia, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Southern Africa and the West Indies.[1]

                    Growing up with six older brothers in India, cricket has always been a part of my life. The bat and ball were like a second set of parents; you don’t remember the first time they came in to your life, but they have always been there. It’s no surprise that I have been playing cricket almost all my life: in our backyard and terrace growing up in Polur, Tamil Nadu; in the streets with neighbourhood kids; in the Fort Ground outside of town on every weekend; and in school with my classmates.
                    <br><br>
                    Playing the game from such a young age led me to understand the nuances of the game better and appreciate the essence of competitive sport even more. I understood very early on that I wasn’t gifted enough to be any good at it, but somehow I have stuck with it and still enjoy a game of cricket whenever I can find the time and space to partake in it.

                Cricket is not just a sport but a way of life. It makes you deal with failure a lot more than success, and every time the “law of averages" or “the dreaded finger" gets you, you simply have to move on, pick yourself up and look ahead to the next opportunity. Playing cricket allows you to understand the struggles involved in trying to put bat to ball, trying to send the ball down in a desired trajectory, and in taking the most routine catch.
                <br><br>
                I played cricket regularly in India until I left for the US when I was 21. Access to cricket was limited for the first few years, but then a club was formed in the university I was in, and I have played club cricket since then, for the past 13 years. When the snow begins to thaw in my part of the country, and spring is in the air, my thoughts become almost entirely about the upcoming cricket season. When it starts in May, the next 4-5 months is just a blur, with games on every weekend. My love for the game has taken me around the world in the last few years, and I have taken the opportunity to play cricket in some form on the road as well. I have had the joy of taking part in net sessions, and play weekend games in Australia, the West Indies and England, while also playing cricket in the streets and parks in India and Sri Lanka as well.

                One of the neat things to do while travelling—for me—is to look out for cricket grounds as the airplane swoops down towards it destination. It is a fruitful exercise in places such as England and Australia, but not so much in other places. England, with its long tradition in the game, has cricket grounds—big and small—dotting the landscape. Australia with its general emphasis on sport and strong roots in cricket is the best place to spot cricket grounds from the air. It’s usually not cloudy, the neatly built suburbs and lack of pollution help in the sighting of cricket fields from great heights.
                <br><br>
                The view of an open green with thin brown strips in the middle is something to cherish. The number of grounds you can spot from the air also indicates the strength of club cricket culture in that place. As one would expect, the club culture is quite strong in England and Australia, where it plays a strong societal role as well.

                My eldest brother stopped playing cricket by the time he turned thirty. In fact, none of my brothers play the game anymore. I have been lucky. Being part of a university club, and covering cricket on and off in the last few years, has given me the chance to stay in touch with the game and so I have. When I see, mainly in England and Australia, men with grey hair and withered bodies padding up, or trundling up for a bowl, there is something deeply satisfying about it. It gives me hope that when I will inevitably get older and more ordinary with my cricketing skills and fitness, I can still drag myself to a cricket ground and have some fun.
                <br><br>
                In places like India, people generally quit playing cricket by the time they are thirty. They do however, watch the game, follow it on television and are passionate about the national team’s fortunes. More than the demands of their lives limiting their ability to play, it is the competitive nature of gully cricket that prevents them from continuing to play cricket in a leisurely fashion, and that’s a shame. Whereas in England and Australia, a strong club culture allows one the opportunity to turn up every weekend of the summer and roll their arm over.
